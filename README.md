AN OPTIMIZED APPROACH FOR INTRA CLASS FRUIT CLASSIFICATION USING DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK

## Abstract
Fruits classification is one of the influential applications of computer vision. However, intra-class fruits classification is a challenging task. Traditional classification models are trained by considering various features such as color, shape, texture, etc. These features are common for different varieties of the same fruit. Therefore, a new set of features is required to classify the fruits belonging to the same class. In this paper, we have proposed an optimized method to classify intra-class fruits using deep convolutional layers. The proposed architecture is capable of solving the challenges of a commercial tray-based system in the supermarket. As the research in intra-class classification is still in its infancy, there are challenges that have not been tackled. So, the proposed method is specifically designed to overcome the challenges related to intra-class fruits classification. The proposed method showcases an impressive performance for intra-class classification, which is achieved using a few parameters than existing methods. To validate its performance, the proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art models and performs best in terms of accuracy, loss, parameters, and depth.
